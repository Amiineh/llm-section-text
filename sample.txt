**Generative AI is a transformative technology**

The last year has seen a spectacular acceleration in generative AI: systems able to generate text / image conditioned on text and images. Those systems can help humans:

● produce superb creative content (text, code, graphics)

● read, process and summarise unstructured content streams thousands of times faster than humans

● interact with the world (exposed through natural or application interfaces) to execute workflows faster than ever before.

The power of generative AI was suddenly demonstrated to the general audience with the release of ChatGPT; this kind of product has been in the making by only a few small teams across the world — the few researchers of these teams are now the limiting factor to create new economic actors in the field.
